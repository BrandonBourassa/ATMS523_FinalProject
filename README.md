# ATMS523_FinalProject


This project primarily employs machine learning techniques and feature importance analysis to investigate the relationship between climate indices and atmospheric river (AR) intensity in different latitudinal regions of the western United States. Machine learning algorithms, such as random forest regression, are utilized to model the influence of climate indices on AR intensity. Feature importance analysis is then conducted to identify the relative significance of each climate index in explaining variations in AR intensity. This approach allows for a data-driven understanding of the complex interactions between large-scale climate patterns and regional weather phenomena, ultimately contributing to improved forecasting and risk management strategies for AR-related hazards.

I am using seasonally averaged variables from the NCEP reanalysis with specified teleconnection and ocean index time-series from the NOAA Phyiscal  Sciencies Laboratory to gather my climate indices observations. For the atmospheric rivers, I am using a seven-decade-long catalog of atmospheric rivers (ARs) making landfall along the North American west coast based on NCEP Reanalysis from Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Both date ranges are from 1950-2022.

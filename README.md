# ATMS523_FinalProject


This project primarily employs machine learning techniques and feature importance analysis to investigate the relationship between climate indices and atmospheric river (AR) intensity in different latitudinal regions of the western United States. Machine learning algorithms, such as random forest regression, are utilized to model the influence of climate indices on AR intensity. Feature importance analysis is then conducted to identify the relative significance of each climate index in explaining variations in AR intensity. This approach allows for a data-driven understanding of the complex interactions between large-scale climate patterns and regional weather phenomena, ultimately contributing to improved forecasting and risk management strategies for AR-related hazards.
